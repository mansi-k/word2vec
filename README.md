# ANLP Assignment 1

[Trained models and intermediate/pre-processed files are available here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LPszozfWcZuMk-bYInBqEKhKjEyNBtXt?usp=sharing)  

### To execute code  
1. Keep all files in the same folder except for the CBOW model in the 'models/' subfolder (same as in Gdrive)  
2. Execute the `pre-process.inpyb` notebook to pre-process and save reviews  
3. Execute the `Q1_SVD.inpyb` notebook for 1st question (skip the cells to create co-occurence matrix if not needed, instead can load the saved co-occurence matrix)  
4. Execute the `Q2_CBOW.inpyb` notebook for 2nd question (skip the cells to train the model if not needed, instead can load the pre-trained model)
