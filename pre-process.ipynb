with the shipping time it arrived a few days earlier than expected\n","within a week of use however it started freezing up\n","could of just been a glitch in that unit\n","worked great when it worked will work great for the normal person as well but does have the trucker option\n","the big truck routes tells you when a scale is coming up ect\n","love the bigger screen the ease of use the ease of putting addresses into memory\n","nothing really bad to say about the unit with the exception of it freezing which is probably one in a million and thats just my luck\n","i contacted the seller and within minutes of my email i received a email back with instructions for an exchange very impressed all the way around\n","im a professional otr truck driver and i bought a tnd at a truck stop hoping to make my life easier\n","rand mcnally are you listening first thing i did after charging it was connect it to my laptop and install the software and then attempt to update it\n","the software detected a problem with my update and wanted my home address so i could be sent a patch on an sd card\n","hello i dont think im all that unusual my home address is a po box that a friend checks weekly and that i might get to check every six months or so\n","i live in my truck and at truck stops\n","if you need to make a patch available on an sd card then you should send the sd cards to the truck stops where the devices are sold\n","i ran the update program multiple times until the program said that the tnd was completely updated\n","i programmed in the height the length and the weight of my rig and told it that i preferred highways\n","i was parked at a truck stop in the cincinnati oh area\n","my next pickup was about miles down the same freeway but on the other side of it a couple of blocks\n","my cell phone gps sprint said to get on the freeway to get to my pickup\n","the tnd routed me thru miles of residential streets before finally getting me to my pickup\n","very exciting especially since every time i refused to turn down a street posted no trucks the tnd took almost minutes to figure a re route and it happened multiple times on that short trip\n","i decided to give it another chance\n","after my pickup on the north side of cincinnati just off of i i needed to head to phoenix az via i\n","easy route is to just hop on i and drive west and south to the intersection of i\n","indeed that is what my cell phone advised\n","the tnd however wanted to route me over surface streets across the city and pick up i on the other side of the city\n","i turned it off and the next time i passed a truck stop of the same chain i purchased it at i returned it and got my money back\n","i then spent on a cheap printer\n","now i take a minute to set up my route on google and print it out\n","hasnt gotten me lost yet over several cross country trips\n","well what can i say\n","ive had this unit in my truck for about four days now\n","prior to that i had a garmin non truck gps\n","one of my favorite features in that unit was the ability to plan a route by determining mileage using the stop or via feature\n","what i would do is using a map i would route myself several different ways forcing the unit by putting in stops or vias at different locations along the route otherwise like most gps s it determines what it thinks is the best route\n","i could add up to vias or stop points for each route and then based on mileage and other factors determine which is the best route to take\n","multiple stops and the ability to route was the most important reason for having the garmin\n","however it was not truck specific\n","and considering i am now hauling strictly hazmat i wanted something that would take that into consideration\n","after perusing various forums review sites and word of mouth my choices boiled down to the garmin or the rand mcnally intelliroute tnd\n","even though it was quite a bit more than the garmin i chose the tnd for several reasons\n","the main one being the extra screen size and its ability to coordinate with the rand mcnally truck atlas and also its ease of updating\n","now on to my first impression of the tnd\n","it seems to be an aesthetically pleasing and durably built unit\n","the first thing i noticed was its very slow to boot compared to my old garmin\n","whether this is unique to the tnd or is common amongst all truck specific gps units i cannot tell but its really not that big of a deal\n","the second thing i noticed was the overwhelming wealth of information put forth\n","that might explain why the manual available via the tnd dock is well over pages long\n","there is somewhat of a learning curve with this unit\n","the next thing i noticed was the complexity of entering routes\n","as previously mentioned i like to force it into my preferred routing by the use of stops or vias\n","that was a big no go with this unit\n","while you can enter multiple stops or vias it is nowhere near as user friendly as my old garmin\n","furthermore there is no way you can determine total mileage on the route that you have chosen as i could with the garmin\n","totally flummoxed by what appeared to be an omission of one of the best routing tools a trucker could have i went online and verified through an expert source connected with rand mcnally that no that feature was a couple updates down the line and was not available at this point\n","also forcing the unit to follow a specific route can be very challenging\n","for a unit of this price and feature laden i find this totally unacceptable\n","i am still mulling over selling this unit and buying the garmin\n","i really do like this gps the screen is magnificent and the volume is awesome\n","another thing ive noticed which i do not think is unique to this unit is some of the weird routing that it does\n","ive never owned a truck specific gps before but after playing with this one for a couple of days i get the impression that what rand macnally and the others that use navteq has done is take a plain old car specific navteq map and a road atlas with truck restrictions and made notifications on the map\n","in most databases there is not a thorough listing of every road in the country\n","what i mean is that this unit will route you down roads you dont belong on\n","today while coming home it tried routing me on several ton county roads\n","what that means is that a truck is limited to unless the road is posted at tons\n","county roads do not have that restriction listed in the rand mcnally road atlas so i believe that is why it is not listed\n","also unacceptable in a unit of this price and sold as truck specific\n","however id be willing to bet the other truck specific units are the same way as no one has ever done a truck specific version of navteq\n","another bone i have to pick is the pois\n","not only the truck specific ones but the others all seem to be somewhat outdated\n","i think the garmin at least the ones that i have used are more current\n","it would also be nice if i could add my own poisto sum it up i will keep this unit a little longer to see if i can make it workable\n","if not i will go back to garmin\n","i like the concept and i like the unit but at this point ill have to say i am somewhat unimpressed\n","pros large screenterrific imagesoutstanding volumecons inability to determine route mileage by multiple stops and viasa somewhat outdated poi information\n","non truck specific routings\n","not going to write a long review even thought this unit deserves one\n","ive driven well over mil miles and done most of my own routing so i pretty know whats the fastest and shortest\n","have been using a basic garmin for the past three years and with any gps unit theyll all get you in trouble if you let them\n","i was really excited about this unit due to the size and the features\n","allot of great grafics and on screen info thats usefull\n","but the most basic item that it was lacking was the gps tracking\n","i gave this unit allot of leadway on its mistakes due to the fact that it had allot of cool stuff that it did but its ability to track you and route you was not even close to what the basic garmin could due\n","its like the prossesor that they installed in the tnd was years old\n","example if i needed to make a simple route change i\n","in town down to the next street due to the fact that i couldnt make the turn or the street was blocked off it would take the tnd upwards of seconds to a minute and a half to reroute me\n","here im sitting at a stop light waiting for directions and waiting that long with cars on my backside didnt make me happy\n","this is a problem that happened evertime you had to reroute weather it was a simple street change or a major highway change\n","also from the time you turned the unit on it would take twice as long to boot itself up\n","at least a dozen times with in a week it put me on the wrong roads and when i made a wrong turn it got it self lost\n","take left on xyz street and it was some ones drive way\n","or turn left in yards and the turn was less than feet away\n","you might think in a conjested city situation i might get a little mixed up but this is out in the country\n","twice it put me under bridges when im\n","of course i made sure all my truck setting where they were supposed to be\n","i also updated the os version via rand mcnally\n","all in all i expected alot out of this unit and got a unit that should of been field tested with some people that drive allot\n","it just had to many route mistakes\n","going back to the basic garmin\n","this isnt just my complaints i have three friends that bought the same unit and have the same complaints\n","all of us returned the units\n","ive had mine for a year and heres what we got\n","it tries to route be down non truck routes while telling me the truck route is illegal for me\n","this is such a bad problem that even interstate in denver colorado is listed according to this gps as a non truck route and will route you through the city instead\n","there are several drivers within our company who own one and more than half of about have crashed to an un recoverable state\n","our company representative said that rand mcnally informed them that the gps was not designed to say on for a long period of time\n","really its a truck driver gps\n","we have one driver with a dollar ticket due to this gps routing him down the wrong road\n","the companies response was to update the unit\n","ive had mine for a year i never noticed one update that corrected functionality they only seem to keep messing the tools\n","i want a gps that routes if i wanted tools id buy software for my computer\n","my suggestion is to by a nice garmen\n","my one rated for cars actually routes me better than this one rated for trucks\n","i am using this with a nook hd\n","it works as described\n","the hd picture on my samsung tv is excellent\n","the cable is very wobbly and sometimes disconnects itself\n","the price is completely unfair and only works with the nook hd and hd\n","this adaptor is real easy to setup and use right out of the box\n","i had not problem with it at all it is well worth the purchase\n","i recommend this adaptor very much for viewing your nook videos on your hdtv\n","i just disagree with other reviews on the length of the adaptor i found it to be fairly adequate as to how and where it is connected to my tv\n","for me it was just right not too long or too short i was able to place my nook right below the connection on the tv stand it did not fall or anything else it is fine\n","use your own judgement im too busy watching my movies\n","this adapter easily connects my nook hd to my hdtv through the hdmi cable\n","this is good for traveling because it makes any hotel tv a potential smart tv so long as there is an accessible hdmi port\n","it is also good for sharing photos from fb on a bigger screen\n","a bit pricey but a good accessory to have\n","be sure to note that this is only for the nook hd and hd series\n","it will not work with a standard nook\n","this product really works great but i found the following items you need to keep in mind you must have your power adapter connected for it to work\n","it plugs in the the bottom\n","it appears it needs power from the nook power adapter to operate\n","the plug fits in loosely and you cannot move the nook around much without holding the adapter in place\n","on initial plugin it seems you need to rock it around to get the connection but then it seems solid\n","it works with a high quality hdmi cable so you can put the nook across the room with you\n","not tested with cheap cables\n","i found that my lg smarttv from a few years back does not work with this adapter but it does not seem to work with many things\n","bad software\n","this adapter works fine with other hdmi devices i have used like monitors and i am sure other tvs\n","gave it five stars because it really is nice to extend the screen and use your nook as a streaming server to your tv\n","nice they made such a device\n","this item is just as was described in the original description works without any issues to be seen\n","good product\n","bought for a spare for my nook hd and it fit perfectly\n","very satisfied with the price much less than on the bn site\n","my son crewed my hd charger cord so i needed another one this is exactly like the one my son destroyed\n","this is a good beefy amp charger but it covers two outlets on a power strip\n","its ok in a regular wall outlet\n","the best thing is it uses a standard usb connector so it can charge more than just a nook i have a kindle fire hd\n","i lost my b n original cable\n","i looked around for an new one\n","i tried a different cheaper model but it didnt fit my device properly so back to the drawing board\n","i ordered this one\n","i am satisfied\n","it works exactly as expected and fits perfectly\n","i would recommend this product to anyone looking for a spare or in lieu of the original usb cable adapter\n","it does and charges a dead nook in a few hours\n","it does so with a lot of heat compared to most wall worts\n","i have a dual charger where port is\n","and the other is for total output of\n","that doesnt run as hot as this\n","and i use that to power a raspberry pi to avoid needing a powered hubit does the job adequately as its designed to\n","just hot\n","i would always unplug it if not using even though it cools off because of the amount of heat made\n","the nook hd runs hot too right where you hold it on the left side in portrait but not so much when charging\n","i guess its better to have it at the plug\n","go to target or barnes and noble instead and pay which is still a huge markup considering they make the thing for cents\n","this is the worst option if you need one of these\n","its price gouging pure and simple\n","works well a little pricey i think for a charging cable but then again not losing the original would be a lot cheaper than any replacement\n","this is a great buy compared to a or more a retail store\n","this mount is just what i needed\n","it is strong and sturdy\n","it folds almost flat to enable the television to sit square and flat against the wall if desired and extends and rotates for angle turns\n","a perfect fit as long as you match the correct visa pattern for your television\n","great deal easy to mount and it appears to be fairly sturdy\n","i mounted a in tv on it and it works great\n","this mount works really well once you get it up and going\n","only problem is just the arms are a little goofy getting them all in the right spot\n","but thats really not too big an issue considering all the different tvs and their mounting hole locations\n","this wall mount does everything its supposed to do\n","the piece that attaches to the wall isnt overly long which made it easier to mount the arm in the tight space i needed to mount it in\n","the only issues i saw was that the joints were very tight initially and as we moved the arm around to install it the joints loosened up to the point where i had to take the included allen wrench and tighten them up again\n","for the price you just cant beat this item\n","i bought it for a house i was selling so i could hang some tv and it worked great\n","good quality for the price\n","i received the mount which was well packaged for shipping\n","the installation instructions were moderately clear\n","no issues following them they were just a little disjointed depending on the wall surface you were installing on\n","my shipment had a mis cut piece and was missing screws\n","i contacted the manufacturer and they shipped me a replacement part and screws the very next day shipped out of texas so normal mailing times applied i like how the mount fits together and i easily mounted my tv by myself\n","the part that attaches to the tv has a hook that will hold the tv on the arm till you bolt it on\n","its very adjustable and pushes almost flush with the wall\n","im very happy but took one star for the miscut piece\n","took a bit of work but used this to fit an older vizio monitor to the wall to use as a compute monitor\n","stable and like the ability to move the tv to different angles\n","the vizio was older and did not have the standard holes this product fit and holds the tv very stable\n","i used this for my samsung\n","its fit feel is great\n","easy installation\n","appears strong although i personally spent way too much on the tv to risk leaving it fully outstretched with too little lag bolts for a long time it is very convenient to be able to move it away from the wall however and i would feel very comfortable tilt or swiveling if needed\n","the movement is fluid and easily adjustable\n","i am very pleased with my purchase\n","this item serves its purpose as well as any other mount\n","its most appealing attribute is its large range of motion\n","i am using this to corner mount a tv and it works perfectly to hide the mount receptacles and cables behind the tv\n","very easy installation as well\n","i love this mount\n","this is the one ive bought and it works great every time\n","excellent seller and excellent product\n","i am very glad for buying it\n","it is heavy duty and good quality for the price\n","it was very easy to install\n","this holds up my sony with ease\n","make sure u mount this with ur own lag screws into the heart of the ur mounting to and u wont have any problem u may have to make a modificatoin or two but use ur brain and figure it out itll be there till the house falls lag screws is the way to go dont be cheap go buy em\n","how much did u pay for the tv\n","nice quality still works great\n","very happy with this purchase\n","need to add more words\n","so what can i say its a wall mount that i havent had any problems with\n","great bracket for small tvs\n","i used it on a lcd and it worked well\n","the large mounting plate may block some connections on some tvs\n","installed easily and could be adjusted to make level\n","the links were very tight and need to be loosened for initial installation\n","when the tv is in the desired position you can tighten them up\n","i bought this for a tv for my son\n","i mounted this onto the corner stud and it works great i love the angles it can achieve\n","fees very sturdy and well built\n","it works perfect for my application\n","very happy with this purchase\n","i am using this mount for a inch vizio tv and it has been great\n","the installation process was quick and easy and we love the variety of angles that you can get from this mount\n","we have it on a side wall in our bedroom and we can pull the tv out and move it completely perpendicular to the wall on which it is mounted if we want to\n","we dont usually move it quite perpendicular but it works to do this\n","my only complaint is that the joints are a little on the stiff side\n","it takes quite a bit of force to move the tv from one position to another\n","its a little hard for my wife to do especially with the tv mounted about up on the wall\n","it may be possible to loosen these pivot points but i have not tried\n","im a little nervous about making it less stable if i do\n","overall its a great mount\n","highly recommended\n","i installed this for my sister who had a philips lcd\n","nice sturdy mount with all of the nuts bolts screws included\n","only problem was that since my tv was so small and i was using the most inner mounting hols on the mount the outside edges of the mount covered both the cable connection and the power cable connection\n","instead of returning then paying from a local store i simply went to a hardware store got a inch boring tool that attaches to a hand drill and drilled holes into the mount\n","it was pretty easy but a bit messy\n","it is not visible after mounting the tv so who cares it is one thing to consider before buying this there may be another mount that does not cover your tv connections\n","otherwise swivels well does not sag good value\n","didnt think it would work as well as it has because the metal was a lighter guage thanwe expected but it hardly deflected from theweight of the tv even extended straight out\n","very heavy duty construction extends tilts perfectlya steal at this pricewill be happy to buy another or if needed\n","well constructed wall mount for tv sets up to inches\n","the mounting plate has numerous holes for varius sets\n","plenty of extra hardware provided\n","price was about of what it would cost on the open market\n","i recommend it highly\n","i used it to mount a lcd tv to the wall\n","i installed it in less than hour and am very happy with the results\n","pros comes with all of the hardware youll need comes with some extra hardware of which i have no idea what it is there for\n","i suspect its a universal hardware pack for several models and not all hardware is used for all models but its nice to have a little extra which is always better than not enough the included level is nice\n","well its cheap but it works the instructions did a decent enough job of explaining how to install the unit\n","cons metal is just a tad on the flimsy side\n","i have no problems trusting it with my lt television but if i were to mount something closer to its maximum rated weight of i think i would be quite a bit nervous about it holding up\n","the holes in the base were just a little bit too wide for my wall stud\n","i think the particular stud i was installing it onto was a typical and if centered the left and right side holes were just a little too far to grab both sides of the stud\n","i had to reposition it so that the center holes were aligned to the left side of the stud and that the right side holes were aligned to the right side of the stud\n","as a result i was only able to install four of the six bolts to hold it in place but i dont feel it will be an issue with my television\n","if your house uses wider studs this probably wouldnt even be an issue\n","the metal does sag just a little bit with the weight of the television on it\n","i mounted the base just a little bit off level to help compensate for this and had no problems getting the television level using the adjustments available to me\n","conclusion all in all its not a bad unit\n","especially for the price\n","yes i would have liked to see a sturdier unit but when you take into account the lt price tag its an excellent bargain\n","i dont think ill have any issue with a static mounting of my tv in the corner of the bedroom but if you are considering installing this unit for a television that will see a lot of traffic constant repositioning etc\n","then you might want to spend more money on something sturdier\n","this mount is excellent\n","it is very well built and sturdy\n","i used it to mount a tv and it fit the need perfectly\n","the price was also very good and much much cheaper than what an inferior mount would cost in a retail store\n","i would definitely recommend\n","works great and is so much cheaper than the more expensive versions at the big box stores\n","it is super easy to install yourself too\n","you just need a drill and a ratchet set to get it into the stud oh yea a stud finder too\n","we bought this for the tv in our gym as it gets moved around a bit\n","its definitely sturdy and works well\n","our tv in there is\n","for the price you cant beat it\n","mine didnt come with any of the screws for the tv but luckily i had some leftover from another mount so i didnt want to bother returning it\n","also not sure what they mean by tilt but mine doesnt\n","the arm extends in and out as said tv swivels left to right but does not tilt up and down as was my expectation\n","otherwise cant beat it for the price as in target best buy etc\n","these are going for\n","cannot beat this deal anywhere else on the web all other retailers are over priced for what you are getting a couple pieces of fabricated metal to hold a tv that articulates this mount is reasonably priced\n","pros easy to install helps to have a cordless driver to drill pilot holes and to drive in lag screws\n","you also need to have a stud finder\n","well fabricated mount does everything advertised i\n","articulates you made need to loosen up some nuts cons really stretching here since this is a

the upward viewing angle of the screen inherent problem with cheaper lcds not being directly in front of a lcd screen this mount corrected this issue by allowing me to tilt down the screen\n","i would strongly recommend this mount if you are in the market\n","this mount is easy to install and very sturdy and is very functional and very affordable for the price\n","works like a charm lies flat on the wall when i want it too and pulls out and swivels like a charm when i need it too the instructions call for it to be mounted into a stud in the wall however mine is mounted directly into the drywall using heavy duty anchors and it works perfect as well this is a great product for an amazing price\n","easey to put together and install\n","used to mount a led flat screen\n","instuction say to mount the complete unit but if you mount the tv to the back plate on the ground first its a one person job\n","well built product for being made in china\n","wish you could buy american made better

feet\n","this was worth the money\n","wanted the monitor off of the desk so we mounted on the wall\n","i would have rather had a vertical adjustment as well but for the price this unit does the job\n","very secure we did have to use concrete bolts thought since we were putting it on an outside wall made of lath and plaster with concrete brick on the outside\n","one of the best features is there is one piece that attaches to the tv and another that attaches to the wall\n","the piece on the tv actually hooks onto the piece on the wall\n","i am really happy with this purchase\n","i live in a studio condo and i needed something to rotate to see from my bed and my couch on the other side of the main room\n","once you figure out which instructions to use several varieties are included to accommodate different scenarios and tvs they are pretty thorough\n","dont be afraid to tighten specific joints and loosen others to get it how you want it\n","originally had bought a different one and be careful of this but it didnt didnt have near the amount of swing as this one does\n","holds the tv fine and the articulation is great\n","we use it in a downstairs bedroom where we can move it

is made well and you get a free hdmi cable and level with it\n","just to know that the tv will sit off center of where the base is placed\n","other than that it has held up and worked\n","this is the best mount i have ever found especially for the price\n","home depot has a nearly identical mount for\n","this mount comes with every fastener you could need from lags hollow wall anchors spacers to

lcd tv i or friends have mounted\n","quality was excellent\n","instructions were clear\n","it was not clear about a tilt feature but there was enough to level it when i finished\n","be careful to get the wall bracket real vertical\n","i was using it for a inch computer screen so i really need it to be level for reading\n","everything i needed plus lots of extra hardware for different

fixed would have worked too\n","this unit was highly rated and the price was right\n","the installation was straightforward and fairly simple\n","the only point at which i needed some help was in balancing the tv while i attached it to the arm otherwise it was all me\n","i think it looks great my wife says it reminds her of being in the hospital\n","sorry honey\n","when we mount thepanasonic viera tc inch plasma hdtvin the living room ill definitely use a flat mount\n","you could spend four times this much on an articulating tv mount but i dont see why you would\n","i gave this mount stars\n","to start because out of the box and mounted on the wall i really liked it for my daughters room\n","the ability to move her tv around so she can play in other areas of the room is a welcomed addition\n","i subtracted star because of the tacky instructions and poor cable management for something that moves at maximum about feet away from the wall\n","more star fell off because now that the tv is mounted the mount seems to sag even though there are two huge lag bolts in a stud mounting it\n","that parts not the problem the problem is where the tv mounts to the plate itself it seems no matter how many washers you use it just does not make full contact\n","also if you move the tv to a new position the mounts seems to want to fall in that direction on its hinges\n","so it must be releveled by yanking on it every time it moves\n","otherwise it works i guess\n","but for id rather have a stationary mount that i never have to worry about\n","i would not set a tv larger than a or

loop to work\n","not a big deal at all however\n","overall i highly recommend this product\n","well worth the money\n","needed a corner mounted flatscreen\n","this did the job well easy to install\n","i had to mount in a metal stud so i used two support boards in the back to distribute the weight more evenly\n","expectations of item met at a fraction of the cost from competitors\n","id never bought one of these mainly due to the high prices in the retail stores\n","i hadnt looked online much and hadnt really needed a monitor mounting device until recently\n","this thing is well built and it does the job\n","its not fancy but if you are just looking for an inexpensive way to hang a monitor tv or pc on the wall this will do the job\n","it comes with a nice bag of heavy duty hardware\n","it is primarily designed for mounting tv sets but you can get it to work with a pc monitor as long as it has the vesa mounting\n","it mainly articulates side to side and in and out\n","itll pivot a bit up and down but thats limited\n","only gave this four stars because its only supporting a tv\n","i think i would be scared to mount a tv on it\n","if you sprang for a or bigger tv spend a little more on a properly rated mount\n","as with any tv mount make sure youre hitting wall studs with the main screws dont just use anchors in drywall or youre asking for trouble\n","lots of hardware included in the kit so mounting any style or brand of tv shouldnt be a problem\n","nothing fancy just decent quality and simple installation\n","as may have been mentioned one must discard the provided phillips screws that the manufacturer provides to affix the bracket to the wall stud\n","use your own\n","the tv i mounted with it is an older flat panel so its a little heavier than the news ones\n","this thing isnt fazed and stays where i put it\n","amazing how easy it is to move my around on this mount and able to hang off one stud\n","nice quality feel to metal it is made of\n","very sturdy\n","the arm is very stiff at first so you have to work it lose\n","however the mount works great just make sure you get that stud just right\n","i was impressed with the quality and happy with the price\n","dont have anything to really complain about\n","except there doesnt seem to be a way or im missing it to tilt the tv up or down ie\n","mounted high on the wall and pointed down towards the chair\n","and i am quite savvy with tools assembly etc\n","and it is difficult to get to the bolt heads on the back of the tv to adjust the angle\n","no reason to not buy it though\n","bought the mount for my dell monitor\n","it fits the dell quite well and i bought it for its reach from the wall its ability to manipulate and its weight capacity\n","and in all those respects im quite happy\n","however there is a noticeable tilt sag to the monitor when i have the arm extended\n","im not so concerned with sag perpendicular to the wall as that was expected but the rotational sag that i sometimes get\n","the mount plate and the extender arms need to be screwed together and there are two holes for each arm to attach to the corner of the plate\n","the holes dont align so i couldnt put two screws in\n","i just used one screw which is not the most secure attachment\n","then i used zip ties to secure the arm better\n","i did this because i had to install the tv asap and could not wait for a replacement\n","also the mounting bracket that attaches to the wall has a larger screw hole on the bottom\n","this means that the bottom can wiggle and the bracket will be misaligned\n","again i did a quick fix\n","i gave this stars and not because it actually stayed up on the wall and is now holding my tv albeit due to my own ingenuity and not the quality of the mount\n","i should not have to do quick fixes on a product like this\n","very happy it looks great im so happy we got it\n","holds good it is a lil hard to get it to the wall\n","other then that its fine i love how we have more room in our room\n","my husband is so happy i ordered this it only cost us free shipping and fast very thankful to the seller\n","i wasnt willing to pay for simply mounting a tv so i bought this item to give it a shot\n","i have no real complaints\n","it holds the tv up which is all i wanted\n","it does not have smooth pivot points so if youre planning on moving it around a lot dont use this one but if its going to stay in a static area this is your mount\n","bought new but i could tell right away that mine had been repackaged and refurbished\n","plus the was missing the arms but had some other random hardware included\n","i made mine work for my set and it serves its purpose\n","just wish the seller was upfront on the condition i could have bought a used one for less\n","this is a rather good tv mount\n","this tv mount works exactly as expected and described\n","i would buy again\n","i had to use a hacksaw to cut away part of this to hang my led tv in my bedroom\n","other than that seems to work fine\n","i have a hannspree lcd tv\n","it weighs\n","most other reviews said they had a tv smaller than this so i was a little skeptical but got it because of the good price and it said it could hold or so lbs\n","most of my reservation was because it was the first time ive mounted a tv and worried it would fall within a week\n","ive had it over a month and its nice to have it be able to swing out extend and angle\n","i like the fact that i can get a bigger tv and still use this mount as its in my living room\n","it was not too hard to install\n","i bought a stud finder because i didnt have one and most everything else i already had to install it\n","i do highly recommend recruiting some help with the install at least for when putting the tv on\n","this would be extremely hard by yourself especially if you have a bigger tv\n","overall very happy with this mount\n","installed easy and in no time at all finding the stud was the hardest part

also\n","our tv documentation stated it was a pattern\n","but after putting hte plate over the back seems we didnt need the extra extenders as its\n","this is on a samsung series ledtv\n","the arm is hard to push and pull but that is more due to being new and stiff\n","make sure you adjust the tilt angle screws as our unit came with them loose so we had to tighten them\n","i initially was scared to mount it what if it falls if i screw up but its pretty easy\n","not only did i use a stud finder to get the general location of the stud but i also used nails to get the actual edges those basic studfinders are never exact\n","make sure you do the same\n","not bad for ish\n","this is a good product\n","it went up easily\n","i did it myself\n","i wish i might have gotten one with a little more

design of this tv wall mount\n","i think this weights more than the tv it is supporting\n","it also has lots of logical adjustments so leveling the tv isnt too difficult\n","the one semi negative is that it takes a fair amount of force to reposition the tv\n","this does assure the tv stays put but if you plan to move the tv on the stand a lot this may be a negative\n","overall i am pleased with the stand it seems like a good value\n","i bought the uint for a tando\n","i couldnt get the parts to line up so i bought another fixed type\n","very well made strong mount the only problem i have is the instructions are very poorly written or detailed\n","pictures do not distinguish between stud mount and concrete\n","also the instructions do not tell you the size of the included boltsfor those of you who have never worked in the home building industry wall studs are usually\n","inches wide so this mount only requires lag bolts in the middle holes to secure it to the wall to support a lb

installed the mount to the wall easy enough attach tv the mount with some screws difficult for one person with one arm i held the tv heavy\n","the other arm was trying to attach some small screws connecting the tv to the mount\n","it took quite an effort to hold the tv for that long\n","certainly having two people installing this would be waaaay easier i have another similar mount where the tv

the wall\n","highly recommend this great quality product\n","this wall mount will secure any of the hdtvs using the vesa or vesa mount pattern\n","we like to use a mount on the larger end than actually needed so if we later upgrade the hdtv with a larger size theres a much better chance we wont need to replace the articulating mount\n","you can spend a ton of money on one of these or you can buy this one\n","hung a inch tv with it with no problems\n","this is a really well made and engineered product which should be twice the price\n","it has every kind of leveling and tilting

but the rest of the device is very solid\n","i will say that the hinges can be a bit tight and its not designed to be easily adjustable on the fly youll need a few tools\n","if you plan on swinging your tv around a lot this might not be the best choice but it works perfectly fine if you only need to adjust it every now and then\n","my favorite part is the small base\n","i didnt have a lot of wall space to mount a tv and this met my needs without eating all my money\n","keep in mind that youll want at least two people to mount the tv on this device\n","i attached my tv alone by precariously balancing it on a stack of boxes while i inserted the screws\n","speaking of which ive mounted two tvs on this and the box included screws which fit both in addition to many more\n","however you may need a few more washers\n","this tv mount i bought for just easily outdoes similar ones that cost over it comes preassembled is easy to mount on the wall and has clear instructions\n","it also features a wire holder and cover for the screws on the wall\n","the joints are a little bit stiff but with use and maybe a drop of oil this shouldnt be a problem\n","definetely a great buy at a agreat price\n","i have purchased this mount twice now one for my bedroom tv and one for my living room tv\n","the bedroom tv is a lcd and the tv in the living room is a led\n","surprisingly enough they both weigh pounds\n","this mount works very well for both of them\n","its relatively simple to install you just need to find a stud and screw the support in to it\n","i will admit that my bedroom tv has been attached not to a wall stud but a jury rigged support brace on a cabinet\n","its still there and attached after months\n","i will say that the joints in the arms are quite stiff it can take a little muscle to move the tv\n","but i think i prefer that it certainly doesnt feel flimsy and it stays wherever i put it\n","a tip for would be purchasers make sure your tv supports this mount\n","you can usually find your compatible vesa patterns in your users manual\n","or a quick online search perhaps\n","as i often say when buying online it pays to do your homework\n","amazon as always stars in service and shipping\n","the mount was for a vizio inch\n","product comes adequate with a lot of screws an alan key and standard nut key that fits all the nuts\n","the bubble level with magnet on the side and cable are a nice addition\n","had to cut inch from the top and bottom of the base that gets screwed no to the tv since it covered some of the inputs\n","other wise very practical for my bedroom study that has more width so the convenience of swirling is why we wanted this and it does a good job\n","for the price and free shipping its is a really good deal\n","would recommend this\n","this device is somewhat weak even for the inch tv weighing only that im using it with\n","after some adjusting its working ok\n","easy to install and the

porch\n","i hung on the sucker and its not coming down\n","and im\n","it needs improment\n","i wish it has one more hole to put a screw on the wall\n","it looks shaky for inch tv\n","however it still

about any view you want\n","the value for cost here is big since most of these sale for over\n","or over\n","at wm\n","im pleased with it\n","mount went up easily and seems sturdy enough\n","however adjusting the tv sometimes leaves the tv crooked\n","also it is almost impossible to adjust tilt without using the provided tools\n","even after using the tools we couldnt really adjust the tilt to the full amount\n","great functionality really incredible price and a snap to install\n","honestly ridiculously good product wish they were all so easy\n","quick and easy installation very solid product\n","very pleased with this purchase\n","when in need of this type mount again i will certainly purchase this brand model again\n","great price on amazon makes it very easy\n","excellent buy we are very pleased with this item\n","it performs very well\n","the instructions were clear\n","it was easy to assemble\n","it holds a tv very well\n","warning do your homework before ordering a tv wall mount mom and dad bought a inch seiki tv and needed it angled on the wall for optimum viewing\n","that is where i the eldest son came into the picture pun intended\n","i knew in advance the location had plywood backing behind the drywall which meant this mount would be easy to install as wood screws would be secure anywhere on the wall\n","but what if it was a typical installation would there be a stud in the wall centered where needed to hold the tv and mount securely it seems unlikely most people would so what are the options option\n","buy a different mount with a mounting plate rather than small hole bracket as on this model\n","if you dont know what i am talking about look at other tv wall mounts and you will see on many of these a large wall plate that can easily cover an area with at least one stud and addtionally allow drywall anchors elsewhere on the plate to handle the weight of any tv\n","this model has only a small wall bracket with holes for screws or anchors\n","use wall anchors\n","again there are only holes in this bracket so take into account the weight of the tv and the rating of the anchors\n","proceed at your own risk\n","install a stud\n","youre on your own with this\n","the mount is well made everything fits and it looks good but as mentioned a little homework will save you time and make installation easy\n","i hope this review is useful\n","too heavy and poor weld quality\n","lot of blow holes in welding though painting was made nice to cover it or else it was made with inefficient welder\n","i think this is is not well designed by experts\n","hope no calculations are involved in making it\n","just copied the shape forms some other manufacturer\n","i bought a funky double hinged wall mount from amazon and it did not work\n","i went to best buy and they said to purchase this wall mount they had i snagged a pic of the measurements and extension ability from the box came home and found this one to be near similar\n","needless to say i now have my in lg flat screen securely mounted and sitting pretty in the corner of my living room\n","i have swivel mounts and this one is not the best\n","if you dont use the swivel feature frequently or dont place it where it may be bumped it will do the job\n","i prefer the strength and stability offered by mounts which have two arms extending from a longer wall bracket\n","these more stable brackets can be found at similar or slightly higher prices\n","also look for a feature which allows the tv bracket and tv to be lifted off the swivel arm more conveniently\n","just in stall another samsung led flat screen\n","outside a patio deck area what a difference this unit made\n","the mounting kit was very easy to use\n","again i did upgraded to using longer heavier mounting bolts\n","that was only\n","more but its worth it in the long run\n","here in earthquake country you nees that support\n","your flatscreen tv retracts a few inches off the wall plus it will look sweet from to from wall area\n","for a good wall mount of a smaller tv this is perfect\n","much cheaper than similar in various stores and actually is more flush compact than i have seen on others with all the adjustments you could want\n","only gripe is that the included wrench to tighten the wall bolts is pretty weak and strips itself almost immediately but itll work to get it on at least\n","all hardware needed is included i had to use a few adapter pieces on my first tv\n","getting ready to hook a second one up on another rooms wall both are screens\n","i feel confident they will be there until i decide to remove em\n","wall stud mounting required but depending on the stud size you may only get two of the three wall bolts into the stud\n","should be enough though\n","i use this arm to mount my inch vizio\n","im surprised my tv has a mount thingy\n","it can tilt left and right up and down\n","i do wish it swiveled the tv so that it wasnt crooked\n","when the bolts get loose my tv looks crooked\n","was a perfect fit for my flat screen tv\n","i would recommend this wall mount for that size tv\n","good wall mount\n","sturdy and does what it is supposed to do\n","in fact it even held a larger tv than what it was listed as capable of holding\n","i believe i mounted a television with this one\n","not a flat flat one either\n","i mounted an older heavy thick one\n","this was half the price of the tv mounts at costco and perfectly fits a vizio tv for the spare bedroom\n","it will work with many different brands so in my book that is great\n","strong sturdy and robust\n","this is possibly one of the best mounting kits ive ever purchased\n","i like the fact that there are pieces so the mounting kit can cater to all models of tv\n","whether they have a rounded or flat back\n","mine had a flat back so i didnt need the extra piece but once that step was cleared it was only a matter of minutes before it went up on my wall\n","the adjustable arm is nice as it is setup in our bedroom\n","at night the tv is angled towards the bed and makes it super easy for both of us to see up on the wall and during the day its turned in another direction towards my desk also making the ability to view the tv while working\n","the material is very strong hubby did a pull up on the bar and it didnt even budge\n","this thing seems as though it will last quite a long time\n","its already been up for over a month and it was a wonderful addition to my master bedroom ill be purchasing more over time for the other rooms in the home with larger model tvs\n","exactly as described\n","very heavy duty\n","lots of parts to make any installation work\n","excellent value\n","fits various monitors and tvs\n","i bought three of these mounts for all the bedrooms in my house\n","i love all three of them\n","all mounts have different tvs on them one is a and a\n","product comes with multiple screw for different tvs\n","outstanding product for the price\n","all tvs have been mount for a little over a year\n","this product is a full motion mount for\n","and it is prime\n","awesome price and quality\n","simple and easy to install and fully equipped for installation\n","if you need a swing arm mount for medium size tv this is one id recommend\n","i mounted this in my rv and it holds a lcd tv dvd combo\n","installation was very easy and the mount works great i was prepared to pay times the price for a mount that would work as i wanted\n","i couldnt be happier\n","got my tv mounted with this above my pc and its been on the wall for a year now\n","no problems with it holds the tv well and its study\n","way cheaper than store bought and its perfect for what i got i got a inch hdtv\n","i really like the action on this mount\n","i purchased a monitor for my wife and this mount really frees up the desktop real estate\n","i would purchase again\n","i have an older very heavy samsung high def tv that weighs substantially more than my new\n","i replaced my old basement crt tv with it installed the videosecu mount easily and it does the job\n","i was amazed the price from amazon was only dollars and with prime i got free day shipping\n","the original price was\n","wow what a reduction\n","used this for a panasonic lcd tv\n","mount works fine instructions were minimal\n","i was able to use the supplied hardware to attach the tv and to attach the mount to the wall\n","i did have a problem hanging the tv per the instructions you have to mount the unit and now attach the tv this was not very easy so i removed the mounting plate at the pivor point and took it off the wall mount mounted this on the tv and now re attached to the tv mount this was a lot easier\n","the product is good and as described\n","i have a vizio tv and somehow this wall mount seems to be a little too weak for my tv\n","i still managed to mount my tv just fine but gets a little paranoid that it will give in within the next few months because the mount wont be able to carry it\n","but the full motion swing feature is amazing especially if you are in a larger room\n","the tv is still hanging from the wall so thats a good thing\n","the info for this wall mount says it is good for up to lbs\n","our old phillips flat screen weighs lbs including the stand and after weeks the tv and mount are secured to the wall via a vertical frame member\n","the mount came with almost every imaginable combination of nuts bolts and spacers and straps to fit various size and brand tvs\n","i had no problem coming up with the right combination for my big and heavy old phillips\n","bought this mount for a panasonic led tv\n","the mount may look cheap but i found it to be extremely sturdy and a great buy for the price\n","i strongly recommend it to everyone\n","good strong mount and quality hardware\n","includes all the different size screws required to attach to tv if yours doesnt have them or if you lost them\n","there is just the right amount of resistance in the joints for it to stay where you want it but still easy to move around\n","i mounted a shelf above the tv to get the cable box out of the way and avoid having to run a long hdmi cable through the wall\n","i took a star only because i received a different unit than the one pictured it has thick arms rather than the that is shown\n","honestly i think what i got is more attractive but i believe that amazon vendors should not substitute different products without authorization\n","my unit also did not come with the extender arms in the picture it has a mounting plate with all of the vesa mounting holes in the correct configuration\n","my tv is so it fit perfectly\n","i am sure my would fit on it too but i have a different mounting configuration for that one\n","very solid\n","we mounted our flat panel in the bedroom\n","like the tipping feature and love the articulating feature\n","we checked prices at stores big boxes etc\n","best price of all including costco\n","i bought this tv swing arm mount for my tv from amazon\n","its been a good one its built heavy duty to hold pretty big tv\n","i would have anyone of my friends buy this same mount for their tv\n","it lets you hang it up and out of the way and also you can turn it out or in adjustable to see it from anywhere i set in my living room\n","this unit is easy to mount on wall and put together by yourself but if you have an extra person around it would make it a little better when holding the tv up when it clips in at top then screw and tighten and adjustments and like everything else ive bought from amazon it ships fast right to your door step\n","easy to attach\n","easy to adjust\n","very solid and secure\n","used on a clients led with built in dvd\n","i have my inch tv on the wall and it works great\n","easy to install and came with all the parts\n","the screws that it comes with for the tv will not fit but you can buy some for dollars\n","for the money you cant go wrong\n","yes it has a litlle play in the mechanism but you can adjust your mounting to accomodate that\n","it works great and frees up counter space\n","i would do it all again\n","why spend times more\n","i love this mount all the adjustments for tilt and extension are awesome holds a sony ex just fine even fully extended\n","even bought another\n","a

used to huddle around laptops to discuss projects\n","now i have a tv for display and this mount makes it possible to put it on any wall and swivel it in any direction depending on how many people need to see the screen\n","really stable no wiggling\n","it is a good value but is not top notch quality\n","if you extend both arms in the same direction the tv inch tilts\n","however if the arm goes right then left the play in the hinges offset each other and it works great\n","the mount itself seems fine it just didnt work with the phillips tv we bought\n","the x arm things did not line up and if they did then the x parts would have covered the holes for the inputs\n","we ended up using one we had had around here\n","seems to be built well though and sturdy\n","got this to replace a peerless paramount wall mount when i got my new tv\n","let me start off by saying it works as advertised\n","but that wont get you stars\n","the problem is installation\n","maybe its my own fault for thinking all tv wall mounts worked like the peerless i had\n","see that one has a separate tv plate that you screw to the tv first\n","then you have the second piece the actual wall mount that you screw to the wall\n","once thats done using the bracket mounted on the tv you hang the tv on the wall mount and secure it with a single bolt\n","one person can easily put a tv on the wall\n","not so much with this one\n","yes i will admit that once its mounted its a more secure connection but its the mounting thats the problem\n","you cant do it alone\n","depending on the weight of the tv you will need at least one helper\n","this mount is one piece which means that you have to hold the tv to the wall mounted plate while attaching it with screws\n","that can get tricky especially with heavier tvs i used it for a while with my old lcd tv which weighs pounds\n","they do get kudos for providing all the screws for all vesa types as well as a regular and an allen wrench\n","three stars for ease of installation five stars for usability for a combined four stars\n","make sure you get help when installing\n","it is up know and should work fine but it was hard to get it to fit my tv due to the bulge on the bottom but i made it work and it is on the wall\n","very strong for any tv but i wish that it was little longer i am very happy with it and very strongly recommended\n","easy install looks great and works great for what we need purchased for game room took min\n","to install and min\n","to set tv on\n","it is a solid mount and i doubt that it will ever fail to hold the led tv that is mounted on it\n","my only complaint is that the bolt that attaches the arm to the wall plate is smaller then the hole in the wall plate so when the tv is anything other than parallel to the wall it leans up to\n","from one side of the tv to the other but for the price i can live with that\n","the mount works but it is unrefined compared to other brands out there\n","purchased because it was on sale\n","just ok\n","i consider myself to be a good diyer\n","ive installed mounts for my samsung and led tvs with no problems for years\n","so for this videsecu mount inspite of poor installation instructions i carfeully measured all domensions to fit my new samsung led smarttv in a limited kitchen space\n","my mistake was based on the diagrams i assumed that the length of both the swinging arms of the mount the single and the double arms were of the same length\n","what a disaster after installing the mount when i mounted the tv and folded the arms the tv did not center itself to the wall side of the mount it was then that i noticed the inner length of the arms is about longer than the outer single arm\n","in other words once the arms on the mount were fully folded in towards the wall my tv was not centered in the limited space that i had and looked awful\n","i dont know why the manufacturer did not keep both arms the same length\n","at least they shd have mentioned it in the instructions\n","this to me is a major product defect\n","luckily with amazon i was able to return this mount but had to pay return s h\n","works great for a cheap mount\n","worked great on a emerson lcd tv\n","does everything as advertised can tighten or loosen joints for easier movement\n","we needed something to extend our tv away from the hot pipe for the winter and this wall mount did the trick\n","it went up with no a problems\n","it worked out very well\n","its a little flimsy and not the easiest to put together for the price it works\n","but for the quality id go with cheetah\n","we needed a wall mount for a tv that was going to be in the screened in porch\n","this was one of the brands recommended by the guy that was going to install out wall mount\n","i can t speak to the ease or difficulty of installation but it looks great and we can swivel it if necessary for best viewing angle\n","its also pretty sleek so it doesnt butt out too much\n","it arrived quickly and it didn t take the installer long but of course he was a professional\n","looks great\n","it works for the tv i bought but i had to use some of my own washers for the screws\n","i thought it would have everything\n","i have mounted a inch old lcd\n","easy to install\n","easy to swivel there is tilt option but it has to be locked by nuts it can not be changed without loosing the nuts\n","i wanted to put my mac in the wall and leave it\n","this does that well\n","i dont move it often it seems strong and well built\n","if you want to move it a lot get something different you have to keep an allen wrench and a crescent wrench in the desk drawer if you plan on moving it a lot\n","the articulation is sketchy\n","for my uses and the cheap price this was perfect\n","i have purchased a total of hdtv wall mounts from the videosecu companyand they are all quality products at a very reasonable price\n","tilt tv mount for stationary tvs up to inches\n","articulating corner mount for small tvs long arm corner or high mobility mount for larger tvsall of them are excellent products and very easy to install\n","received this item quickly and well packaged but not so well that i was infuriated trying to open it everything was in perfct order\n","strong handsome appearance\n","installation kit is perfectly in order and gives a ton of options for different senarios\n","couldnt possibly be happier with this product\n","could offer a little more in flexibility of installation but once in place the set can be placed in just the right position repeatedly\n","the directions stink\n","just remember the spacers go under the arms if you have to use them and you will be ok\n","it is better than spending twice the money on this going into a brick and mortar store\n","was very pleased\n","good quality\n","must mount on a stud\n","i mounted to a metal stud by cutting a rectangle hole in wall adding a ft in the metal stud track patched the hole and then put up the mount\n","holds a tv without a problem even added a dvd player to the bottom of the tv and it is still on the wall after about months\n","price on this item was great and it was sent with free freight\n","this item didnt disappoint\n","its sturdy has all the screws included for different flat screen models and yes it works well\n","this worked perfect\n","the universal design would fit\n","of the tvs as advertised\n","easy to mount and very durable\n","i have a full hd flat screen mounted on this\n","not only does everything look better than strapped to a table but the adjustability makes this mount a pleasure to have\n","it was simple to attach to the wall and has a small footprint being a single stud wall mount\n","the other major point of this mount is how many sized tv or monitors the mount can be adjusted to accept\n","my tv mounts solidly and the mount itself is solid yet adjusts with little effort\n","this is just plainly a good and solid product that is well worth the money\n","had a couple of guys put this up for me but they said it was easy to install\n","i like the fact that i can move it around easily and tilt it anyway i want it to be\n","this

good articulation\n","my only comments are the cord clips included are very weak\n","i will be replacing them with black cable ties\n","also they do need to have a second locking screw where you hang

recommend for a tv that is\n","easy to install with extra hardware for installing your tv\n","however my tv had a curved back so i used the included spacers to space the bars on the back of the
